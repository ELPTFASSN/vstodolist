Todo List Visual Studio Extension
===============

A visual studio extension for easy management of your current coding tasks.
Such list will be very usefull when you just have started a project and haven't yet written a single line of code, but you want to track your ideas. Sometimes such tasklists are used by developers, writing a test-driven code.
This extension is open-source and it's still WIP. Feel free to download the source code and modify it at your will.
